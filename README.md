# Mewdistro

Mewdistro is a small custom ROM designed for transferring Pokémon to Gen 1 and 2 (through time capsule) Pokémon games. At this moment, it's capable of transferring a legitimate Mew that was distributed during the Spanish Pokémon Championship in the year 2000, with the OT/ EUROPE.

## Building
You need **gbdk-2020** to build the project (version 4.20 was used at the time of writing this but I guess newer ones will also work). Then simply run `make`.
